						<h3 style=text-align:Left> Dinosaurs (19/05/2020) </h3>
					 <p style=text-align:Left>
			We are finally back at school this week! (Obviously with safety precautions in place to ensure the safety of students) Our focus for this week is on paleontology!
			<br>
			<br>
			Some key objectives of this session:
			<ol>
				<li> Some modern birds today are descendants of dinosaurs.</li> 
				<li> Many pieces of evidence support modern birds such as chickens, being related to dinosaurs. </li>
				<li> The bone structure of dinosaurs can be built with only small existing pieces of fossils. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
This session, we were extremely fortunate to be able to have Dr Daniel Thomas from Massey University zoom in to have a discussion and QnA session with our students! We discussed various subjects in the field of paleontology, including dinosaurs that are specific to New Zealand!
		
			<br>
			<br>
		
After the QnA session, the students carried out an activity. For the activity, we got wood cutouts of dinosaur bone structure that can be assembled by the students. We put these individual bone pieces inside trays of sand and asks the students to assemble these using the skills Dr Thomas described.

		 <p style=text-align:Left>
In this weeks 'Care package', the main focus is, again, on acid and base reactions!
<br>
<br>
Some key objectives of this module:
<ol>
	<li> Neutralization reaction happens between an acid and a base.</li> 
	<li> Carbon dioxide gas is produced in neutralization reactions. </li>
</ol>
<p>
One of the possible 'at home' experiments, is building a volcano. Below are the instructions.
<br> 

<ol>
	<li> 1. In the centre, use a container to hold liquid. Depending on how big you are making your volcano, this can be an old water bottle, soda bottle with the top cut off, or even a simple glass jar.</li> 
	<li> 2. Add ingredients to your container. This includes water, vinegar, dish detergent and food colouring. Do not add your baking soda at this stage. </li>
	<li> 3. Add the baking soda when you are ready for an eruption. Wrap the baking soda in tissue and drop into the volcano. The baking soda will react with the vinegar and cause the eruption. </li>
</ol>
<p> Here is a video demonstration from one of our students! </p>

			<h3 style=text-align:Left> COVID-19 Update </h3>
			<p style=text-align:Left>
Due to national lockdown, we are unable to continue running the Science Club. Despite this, we still want to be able to engage students in science every day. We have decided to move out resources online where every week, we will upload science "care packages". These will include resources such as videos, simulations, worksheets, and experiments that can be done at home.

			<h3 style=text-align:Left> Making the Rainbow (10/03/2020)</h3>
		 <p style=text-align:Left>
Today, our students explored concepts of acids and bases. 
<br>
<br>
Here are some key learning objectives for this activity: 
<ol>
	<li>Understand the properties of different chemicals, how they can be neutrals, acids, or bases.</li> 
	<li> pH indicators and the pH scale can be used to determine whether a solution is acidic or basic </li>
	<li> When an acid reacts with a base, the process is called naturalization. </li>
</ol>
<p>
In this activity, we used Hydrochloric acid (HCl) as the acid, Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the base, and universal indicator. 
<br> 
The students started by adding some acid into a tube along with a few drops of universal indicator. Then very carefully, the base is added, all without mixing. The result is a rainbow in a tube, created by the different regions of pH.

			<h3 style=text-align:Left> Flying Far (17/03/2020)</h3>
		<p style=text-align:Left>
In this session, we looked into the scientific inquiry process and mechanics.
<br>
<br>
Here are some key learning objectives for this activity: 
<ol>
	<li> The Scientific inquiry process is the process by which scientific data is collected.</li> 
	<li> Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. </li>
	<li> A plane flies when all four forces – lift, weight, thrust and drag – work together. </li>
</ol>
<p>
In this activity, we used different types of materials to make the paper plane from and multiple different models.
<br> 
We started by observing the different properties of the different materials. From this, a hypothesis is constructed for two of the materials. The students then used those two materials to construct two model planes and tested their hypothesis. 
			<br>
